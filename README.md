# LeaveNoTrace

By [infrar3d](https://github.com/Infrar3dd)

You can easily delete logs and history in your penetration testing

Usage:
```bash
leavenotrace.sh [options]
Options:
  -h | --help Print this message and exit
  -u | --username Target username (default is from whoami)
  -t | --time Time in minutes
  Example:
  leavenotrace.sh -u admin -u user1 -t 60 (It will clear logs from admin, user1 and this user)
```

At first you need to root the machine and then you can clear traces after that
